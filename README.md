MAGE-TAB Check
================

This is a validation library for [MAGE-TAB](https://annotare.googlecode.com/files/MAGE-TABv1.1_2011_07_28.pdf "MAGE-TAB v1.1 spec") file format, which is used to describe functional genomics experiments in [ArrayExpress](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/ "ArrayExpress home page") archive. The first version of validator was developed by [Annotare](https://code.google.com/p/annotare/ "Annotare 1.0 home page") project team, and then moved to sorceforge as part of [Limpopo MAGE-TAB Parser](http://limpopo.sourceforge.net/ "Limpopo parser home page"). Since then it was not changed much.

Magetabcheck is the next version of the validator.
